# Exercise 5
# Take two lists, say for example these two:
#  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
#  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
# Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.
#

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

ia = 0
for ib in range(0, len(b)):
        for i in range(ia, len(a)):
                if a[i] == b[ib]:
                        print(b[ib], "in both lists")
                        ia = i
                        break
